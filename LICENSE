Introduction

MIT License
-----------

The Brill Framework (Client, Middleware and Server) is distributed under the MIT License, a copy of which 
is below. All source code modules covered by the MIT license contain the following first line:

// © 2023 Brill Software Limited - Brill Framework, distributed under the MIT license.

The MIT license is a permissive license, meaning it carries very few restrictions 
and basically allows you to do whatever you want with the code.

Your modifications
------------------

You can make modification to the Brill Framework modules and mark the changes with your own choice
of license. For example:

// Original: © 2023 Brill Software Limited - Brill Framework, distributed under the MIT license.
// Modifications: // © 2023 Traders Inc. - Trading App, distributed under the Traders Inc. license.

You don't need to identify the exact lines of code that were changed, as these can be found using Git.

It would be appreciated if you were able to make any generally applicable changes and fixes under the MIT 
license, so that they could be included into future releases of the Brill Framework.

Your Applications and Components
--------------------------------

Any applications developed by you using the Brill Framework are by default 
your copyright with "all rights reserved". To change this, place a copyright
notice on the first line of each module and specify the license. For example:

// © 2023 Traders Inc. - Trading App, distributed under the Traders Inc. License.

You can sell any applications and components you develop, using your choice of license. 
Make sure to read and follow the license terms of any third party components you use.

Brill Software Apps License
---------------------------

Applications developed by Brill Software are covered by the Brill Software Apps license, 
a copy of which is below. Modules covered by the Brill Software Apps license contain the 
following first line copyright notice or similar depending on the App:

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"The License" refers to version 1.0 of the Brill Software Apps License.

"App" refers to the pages, database scripts, resource files and React 
components that comprise an application and are the copyrightable work licensed 
under this License.

"source code" refers to the Typescript component code and JavaScript code.

"You" refers to the Licensee. The licensee could be a person or an orgransiation.

"personal use" refers to usage by, only and only, the licensee, and not by any 
other person or organisation related in any way to the licensee.

1. Usage

You are free to download, copy, compile, study and refer to the source code, pages, 
database scripts and other resource files for an evaluation period of 30 days.

After the 30 day evaluation period, if you wish to continue to use the App, you need
to purchase a license. See the Brill Software Pricing page for more details.

Usage by you of any work covered by this license should not, directly or indirectly, 
enable its usage by any other individual or organisation.

2. Modifications

You are free to make any modifications to the source code, pages, database scripts 
and other resource files covered by this license. You are also free to compile the 
source after modifying it and using the complied product obtain thereafter in 
compliance with this License. You may provide such modifications back to Brill 
Software, as you see fit, but there is no obligation on the part of Brill Software 
to include such modifications into future releases.

3. Redistribution

You may redistribute the Brill Framework, including your own applications, but not 
with the Brill Software Apps included. The Brill Software Apps are to be deleted 
by removing the app top level directory and its contents. You may also want to 
delete the App specific components, but this is at your discretion.

If you wish to redistribute any Brill Software Apps, please contact Brill Software 
to obtain permission.

4. Non-compliance

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Brill Software Apps except 
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Brill Software Apps is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License.

5. Acceptance of License

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, 
nothing else grants you permission to modify or use the source. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
using the source ( or any work based on the source), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
redistributing or modifying the source or works based on it.

6. Permissions

If you intend to incorporate the source code, pages, database scripts and resource files in 
part or whole, into any free or proprietary distribution, you need to explicitly write to the 
Brill Software to ask for permission.

7. No Warranty

The source code licensed under this license is shared "as is". Since it is intended for 
sharing as reference, there is no warranty, of either source code, or the app compiled
from it. The entire risk of quality or performance of the app is with you.

THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE APP IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL
, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
THE APP ( INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE APP TO OPERATE WITH 
ANY OTHER APPS OR PROGRAMS )

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
