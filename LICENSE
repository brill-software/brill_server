Introduction
============

Community Edition
-----------------

The Brill Community Edition is distributed under the MIT license. See below.

The MIT license is a permissive license, meaning it carries very few restrictions 
and basically allows you to do whatever you want with the code.

Source code modules have the following first line:

// © 2023 Brill Software Limited - Brill Framework, distributed under the MIT License.


Enterprise Edition
------------------

The Enterprise Edition provides some additional features specifically for Enterprise customers.

To make use of the Enterprise Edition features you require an Enterprise License, which can be
obtained from Brill Software.

Enterprise Edition Source code modules have the following first line:

// © 2023 Brill Software Limited - Enterprise Edition, distributed under the Brill Software Enterprise Edition License.


Your modifications
------------------

You can make modification to the Brill Framework modules and mark the changes with your own choice
of license. For example:

// Original: © 2023 Brill Software Limited - Brill Framework, distributed under the MIT License.
// Modifications: © 2023 Traders Inc. - Trading App, distributed under the Traders Inc. license.

You don't need to identify the exact lines of code that were changed, as these can be found using Git.

Where possible, please use the MIT license and then the changes can be shared with others.


Your Applications and Components
--------------------------------

Any applications developed by you using the Brill Framework are by default 
your copyright with "all rights reserved". To change this, place a copyright
notice on the first line of each module and specify the license. For example:

// © 2023 Traders Inc. - Trading App, distributed under the Traders Inc. License.

Pricing page for more details.

Usage by you of any work covered by this license should not, directly or indirectly, 
enable its usage by any other individual or organisation.

2. Modifications

You are free to make any modifications to the source code, pages, database scripts 
and other resource files covered by this license. You are also free to compile the 
source after modifying it and using the complied product obtain thereafter in 
compliance with this License. You may provide such modifications back to Brill 
Software, as you see fit, but there is no obligation on the part of Brill Software 
to include such modifications into future releases.

4. Non-compliance

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, 
nothing else grants you permission to modify or use the source. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or 
using the source ( or any work based on the source), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
redistributing or modifying the source or works based on it.

6. Permissions

and resource files in part or whole, into any free or proprietary distribution, you need 
to explicitly write to the Brill Software to ask for permission.

7. No Warranty

sharing as reference, there is no warranty, of either source code, or the programs compiled
from it. The entire risk of quality or performance of the app is with you.
